### Relationship with Guides
This FHIR implementation guide has the following relationships with other FHIR implementation guides:

* [International Patient Summary](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/) - all profiles and constraints are inherited from the International Patient Summary guide.
* [US Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/) - we refer to the race and ethnicity extensions from the US Core guide.  As well, implementers in the US are recommended to implement US Core.
* [Vulcan Schedule of Activities (SOA)](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/vulcan-schedule) - the project team that developed this guide worked closely with the Schedule of Activities project team.  It is intended that, in the future, the data retrieved via the processes in this Real Word Data guide would be useable in adding to a Schedule of Activities as defined by the SOA guide.
