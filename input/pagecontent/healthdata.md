### Data Sharing Considerations
#### Communication with EHRs
How will we receive FHIR data from the EHR?
	- receive a data dump and do queries on that data?
		- getting refreshes periodically?
	- able to query an EHR multiple times?
	- able to query an EHR once to get data for a specific patient?
	- EHR push the data to a CTMS

#### Patient Consent to Share Data
EHRs will be gathering Patient consent and they will share what data they can.
